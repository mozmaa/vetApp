# vetApp
This will be a web app for a local vet ambulance.

Goals for this project will be practicing back-end (Java) and front-end (React).
The app will be structured in the following way:
- Welcoming page with info about the ambulance (work-time, staff, pictures , etc).
- Users will have options to sing up on the app, register their pet (using chip number, passport, etc),
allowing them to have a look up in pets history of diseases, treatments, etc. They will have and option to
set reminders to be sent on their e-mail/ phones (such as revaccination, parasites protection, yearly blood test, etc)
- Administrators will have optins to update, add, delete products in the ambulance.
Update diagnosises, save receipts, have search otpions for everything to make their life easier.

As I work on this project I will be updating this file with techologies I used, what I thought was right to do,
if I learn something new in mean time I will update code , and mark it with info why did I do it and how.
